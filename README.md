# ZoomKeys

Covert keylogging has been an active area over the past few years, but in light of the recent events with COVID-19, eavesdropping over video-conferencing apps is now even more of a concern than ever before. In order to investigate the security vulnerabilities present in video-conferencing apps, we attempt to develop a system for covert keylogging over Zoom, one of the most popular video-conferencing platforms during the 2020 pandemic. We utilize peakfinding algorithms for keystroke detection and a convolutional neural network architecture for keystroke classifica- tion, and achieve above-chance top-1 accuracies of around 10% on held-out data. Although above chance, such a low accuracy is likely not sufficient to recover full typed passwords from audio recordings, at least demonstrating the difficulties of extracting key strokes from Zoom audio data. We hope to investigate additional architec- tures like RNNs or Transformers, which could additionally incorporate time between keystrokes, for future work.
